# NUS-tour-backend
Mainly backend code for the App.

NUS school bus routes and campus tour

Based on **JDK 11** and **Spring Boot**.



## Running the APP

Run the `CampusApplication.main` would be OK.

Default running port is on 8004. So can access [http://localhost:8004/user/10](http://localhost:8004/user/10) for test. The page would be a json object like,

```json
{"id":0,"username":null}
```



### API document 

Use swagger to generate API document, default API page is [http://localhost:8004/swagger-ui.html#/](http://localhost:8004/swagger-ui.html#/)
